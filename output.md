It sounds like you're going through a tough time, and it's completely okay to feel that way sometimes. Anxiety and low energy can be really challenging to deal with.

When you're feeling this way, it can be helpful to take small steps to nurture yourself. Maybe try spending a little time in nature, listening to calming music, or doing something gentle that you enjoy, like reading or a simple hobby. Remember, even small moments of self-care can make a difference.

Is there anything specific that you think might be contributing to these feelings?
